# Feature Documentation - Audio Recorder App

The following table outlines the implementation status of features in the Audio Recorder App:

## Recording Features:

| Feature Description                     | Implemented | Notes                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Start Recording                         | Yes         | Utilizes Expo's Audio API. Refer to the `startRecording` method in the core component located at `audio-recorder-react-native/src/components/Recorder/Recorder.tsx`. |
| Pause Recording                         | Yes         | Allows pausing and resuming during recording. Refer to the `pauseRecording` method in `Recorder.tsx`. |
| Resume Recording                        | Yes         | Resuming after a pause creates a new recording segment and then combines all segments into one. This was the most challenging part, as Expo doesn't natively support multi-segment recording. It involves complex state management and synchronization with animations, ensuring smooth transitions and accurate duration. |
| Stop Recording                          | Yes         | Stops recording and saves the audio file. Clicking the "Done" button stops the recording and saves the recorded audio. Refer to `stopRecording`. |
| Reset Recording                         | Yes         | Resets and restarts the recording process. Refer to `resetRecording`. |

## Playback Features:

| Feature Description                     | Implemented | Notes                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Play Recording                          | Yes         | Supports playback of recorded audio, including single segments and arrays of segments resulting from resume and pause actions. Implementation details can be found in `audio-recorder-react-native/src/hooks/useAudioPlayback.tsx` under `playSound`. |
| Pause Playback                          | Yes         | Allows pausing and resuming during playback. Refer to `pauseSound` in `useAudioPlayback.tsx`. |
| Resume Playback                         | Yes         | Resumes playback after pausing. |
| Stop Playback                           | Yes         | Stops playback and resets progress. Refer to `stopSound` in `useAudioPlayback.tsx`. |
| Recording Status Indicator              | Yes         | Displays recording status with a visual indicator, including an audio waveform that changes color during playback. Implementation details can be found in `audio-recorder-react-native/src/components/AudioWave.tsx`. |
| Display Recording Duration              | Yes         | Displays the duration of the recording. |
| Save Multiple Recordings                | Yes         | Refer to the `FlatList` implementation in `audio-recorder-react-native/src/screens/RecordingsScreen.tsx`. |
| Display List of Saved Recordings        | No          | Basic functionality implemented: The recordings are listed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent recording appearing at the top. The list is scrollable, allowing users to browse through their saved recordings|
| Delete Saved Recordings                 | No          | Refer to the `onDelete` method in `audio-recorder-react-native/src/components/RecordingListItem.tsx`. |
| Error Handling and Permissions Requests | Yes         | Error handling added for both recording and playback operations. |
| Basic Styling                           | Yes         | Supports user-friendly styling and animations, with visual indicators for recording status and waveform animations during playback. |

## Additional Features:

1. **ESLint**: Utilized for code linting.
2. **Jest**: Implemented unit tests for utility functions as an example.
3. **Abstracted Styles**: Centralized management of styles through `color.ts` and `spacing.ts`.

## Areas for Improvement:

1. **Combine Recordings Server-Side**: Instead of saving multiple recording segments on the client side, it would be better to send the segments to a server and use a service like FFmpeg to merge them into a single file, then return the final merged audio to the client. There are some paid services available that offer this functionality.

2. **CI/CD**: Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines for deployment.

3. **Testing on Multiple Devices**: The app should be tested on a variety of mobile devices to ensure compatibility and performance across different platforms. Currently, the app has only been tested on an iPhone, as I only have one iPhone. Expanding testing to include Android devices and different screen sizes would help identify any platform-specific issues or optimizations needed.

4. **Persistent Storage for Recordings**: An improvement could be to implement persistent storage for recordings, allowing users to save and access their recordings even after closing the app. This can be achieved by storing the recording files locally on the device using `expo-file-system` and managing the file paths with `AsyncStorage` or another suitable local storage solution. This would provide a better user experience by ensuring that recordings are not lost and can be easily accessed or managed later.
